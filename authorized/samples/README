About:
    A sample coffee store application that demonstrates the AIM and DPM integration methods.

Requirements:
    - PHP 5.2+
    - A web server such as Apache.
    - The Authorize.Net PHP SDK
    - For DPM, a public web server that is accessible from a domain name and/or IP address.
    
Usage:
    - Update the config.php file with the path to your copy of the Authorize.Net PHP SDK, as well
      as your API Login and Transaction Key.
    - If you want to try out AIM, you can now try the demo by accessing your_store/index.php from your
      web browser.
    - To try the Direct Post Method, you'll also have to update a few more settings as documented in the 
      config.php file and make sure your web server is publicly accessible.
